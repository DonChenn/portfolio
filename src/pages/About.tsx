      <p>
        Computer Science Hello! My name is Donovan. I am a fourth-year UC Irvine
        student pursuing a B.S in Computer Science with a specialization in
        Intelligent Systems! I have a strong interest in full-stack development.
        I am driven by a desire for continuous learning, and I am always seeking
        new opportunities to refine my skills. Outside of my professional
        interests, you can find me getting boba, playing basketball, or even
        with my film camera taking pictures!
